A simple but complete Dapp. Although not riveting, it has all the fundamentals of a modern web3 application. The project prioritized type safety, code cleanliness, modularity, and correctness. I chose Next 14 for its ability to be a compelling frontend library, while also allowing backend functionality, such as REST routes and server components/actions. Solidity and Hardhat were used to create and deploy our smart contract. Additionally, I used Typechain to create all the necessary typings and ABIs when compiling the smart contract. Ethers.js was used on the client side to interact with the smart contract and connect to the user's metamask.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
> Next 14 requires node ^18.17

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
